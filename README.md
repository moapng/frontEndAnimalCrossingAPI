# frontEndAnimalCrossingAPI

This React project acts as frontend by consuming https://github.com/moapng/backEndAnimalCrossingAPI 

It shows the different creatures one can obtain in the game Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Clicking on an item shows more information, such as which months of the year it is available as well as selling price. 


# Getting started

Download the backend and open it with the IDE of your choice. Start the backend-project. A browser will open at localhost:XXXX/fish which gives you an example of the JSON-data acquired from the restFUL API. Make sure the localhost:XXXX in the different pages in this project is the same as the localhost:XXXX from the backend project.

After downloading the front-end you will need to open the terminal and run the command
* npm start

If that does not work, you might need to run the command
* npm install

and then

* npm start.

A browser will open and there you have it, thatâ€™s the project!
